== Install Prove

Standard Perl distribution with version older than `5.10` doesn't contain `Prove`.
So if happen to deal with such system, you have to install `Prove`
manully.

We will give a tutorial to manually install `Prove` on `CentOS 6.5`.

== Tutorial

`Perl` use link:http://www.cpan.org[CPAN] to manage package, `CPAN` isn't shipped with `Perl` 
older than `5.10`, so install `CPAN` first.

[source,console]
----
➜  ~ sudo yum install perl-CPAN
----

Once `CPAN` installed, use `CPAN` to get `Prove`.

[source,console]
----
➜  ~ cpan
cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.9402)
Enter 'h' for help.
cpan[1]> get App:Prove
...
CPAN: File::Temp loaded ok (v0.22)

cpan[2]> force install App:Prove
...
----

And now you can run `Prove`
[source,console]
----
➜  ~ which prove
/usr/local/bin/prove
----
