== Install Prove

Standard Perl distribution with version older than `5.14` doesn't contain `Prove`.
So if happen to deal with such system, you have to install `Prove` yourself.

➜  ~ sudo yum install perl-Test-Harness

== Debian/Ubuntu

In `Ubuntu 12.04`, there is only `perl-base`, but `Prove` belong to `perl`

[source,console]
