== Test Suite Layout

Projects using `Test::Nginx` to drive their test suites usually have a
common directory layout and common test file name patterns to organize
their tests. This makes it easy for the user to reason about the
location of the test suite in a project source tree and the usage of
the tests. It is not really required, however, to use this common
convention; it is just highly recommended.

By convention, such projects have a `t/` directory at the root of their
source tree where test files reside in. Each test file contains test cases
that are closely related in some way and has the file extension `.t` to
easily identify themselves as "test files". Below is the directory tree
structure of a real-world test suite inside the
link:https://github.com/openresty/headers-more-nginx-module[headers-more-nginx-module]
project:

....
└── t
    ├── bug.t
    ├── builtin.t
    ├── eval.t
    ├── input-conn.t
    ├── input-cookie.t
    ├── input-ua.t
    ├── input.t
    ├── phase.t
    ├── sanity.t
    ├── subrequest.t
    ├── unused.t
    └── vars.t
....

When you have many test files, you can also group them further with sub-directories
under `t/`. For example, in the link:https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module[lua-nginx-module]
project, we have sub-directores like `023-rewrite/` and `024-access/` under
its `t/` directory.

In essence, each `.t` file is a Perl script file runnable by either `perl`
or Perl's universal test harness tool named link:http://perldoc.perl.org/prove.html[prove].
We usually use the
`prove` command-line utility to run such `.t` files to obtain test results.
Although `.t` files are Perl scripts per se, they usually do not have much
Perl code at all. Instead, all of the test cases are declared as cleanly
formatted "data" in these `.t` files.

NOTE: The test suite layout convention we use here are also used by the
Perl community for many years. Because `Test::Nginx` is written in Perl
and reuses Perl's testing toolchain, it makes sense for us to simply follow
that convention in the NGINX and OpenResty world as well.
