== Test::Nginx

link:https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Nginx[Test::Nginx] is a test framework
that drives test cases written for any
code running atop NGINX, and also, naturally, the NGINX core itself. It
is written in Perl because of the rich testing facilities and toolchain
already accumulated in the Perl world for years. Fortunately, the user
does not really need to know Perl for writing test cases atop this scaffold
since `Test::Nginx` provides a very simple notation to present the test
cases in a specification-like format.

The simple test specification format, or language, used in `Test::Nginx`
is just a dialect of the more general testing language provided by the
link:https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Test-Base/lib/Test/Base.pod[Test::Base]
testing module in the Perl world. In fact, `Test::Nginx` is just a subclass
of `Test::Base` in the sense of object-oriented programming. This means
that all the features offered by `Test::Base` are available in `Test::Nginx`
and `Test::Nginx` just provides handy primitives and notations that simplify
testing in the NGINX and OpenResty context. The core idea of `Test::Base`
is so useful that we have been using testing scaffolds based on `Test::Base`
in many different projects even including Haskell programs and Linux kernel
modules. `Test::Nginx` is such an example we created for the NGINX and
OpenResty world. Detailed discussion of the `Test::Base` framework itself
is beyond the scope of this book, but we will introduce the important features
of `Test::Base` that are inherited by `Test::Nginx` in the later sections.

`Test::Nginx` is distributed via link:http://www.cpan.org/[CPAN], the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network, just like most of the other Perl libraries. If you
already have `perl` installed in your system (many Linux distributions
ship with `perl` by default), then you can install `Test::Nginx` with the
following simple command:

[source,bash]
----
cpan Test::Nginx
----

For the first time that the `cpan` utility is run, you may be prompted
to configure the `cpan` utility to fit your requirements. If you are unsure
about those options, just choose the automatic configuration option (if
available) or just accept all the default settings.

`Test::Nginx` provides several different testing classes for different
user requirements. The most frequently used one is `Test::Nginx::Socket`.
The rest of this chapter will focus on this testing class and its subclasses.
We will use the names `Test::Nginx` and `Test::Nginx::Socket` interchangeably
from now on to mean the `Test::Nginx::Socket` test module and its subclasses,
unless otherwise specified.

NOTE: There is actually another different testing scaffold called `Test::Nginx`,
created by Maxim Dounin and maintained by the official NGINX team. That
testing module is shipped with the link:http://hg.nginx.org/nginx-tests/file/tip[official
NGINX test suite] and has no
relationship with our `Test::Nginx` except that both of these are meant
to test NGINX related code. The NGINX team's `Test::Nginx` requires the
user to directly code in Perl to convey all the test cases, which means
that tests written for their `Test::Nginx` are not data driven and requires
decent knowledge about Perl programming.
