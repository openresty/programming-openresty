== Test File Layout
:special_data_line: __DATA__

Test files usually have a common file extension, `.t`, to distinguish themselves
from other types of files in the source tree. Each test file is a Perl
script per se. `Test::Nginx` follows a special design that decomposes each
test file into two main parts: the first part is a very short prologue
that consists of a few lines of Perl code while the second part is a listing
of the test cases in a special data format. These two parts are separated
by the following special line

....
__DATA__
....

The `perl` interpreter or the `prove` utility stop interpreting the file
content as Perl source code once they see this special line. Everything
after this line is treated as *data* in plain text that is reachable
by the Perl code above this line. The most interesting part of each `.t`
test file is the stuff after this line, i.e., the data part.

NOTE: The special `{special_data_line}` notation is a powerful feature
of the Perl programming language that allows embedding arbitrary free-text
data in any Perl script files that can be manipulated by the containing
Perl scripts themselves. `Test::Nginx` takes advantage of this feature
to allow data-driven test case specifications in a simple format or language
that is easily understandable by everyone, even those without any prior
experiences in Perl programming.

=== The Prologue Part

The first part, i.e., the "prologue" above the `{special_data_line}` line
is usually just a few lines of Perl code. You do not have to know Perl
programming to write them down because they are so simple and seldom or
never change. The simplest Perl code prologue is as follows:

[source,perl,linenums]
----
use Test::Nginx::Socket 'no_plan';
run_tests();
----

The first line is just loading the Perl module (or class), `Test::Nginx::Socket`
and passing the option `'no_plan'` to it to disable test plans (we will
talk more about test plans in later chapters and we do not bother worrying
about it here). `Test::Nginx::Socket` is one of the most popular classes
in the `Test::Nginx` test framework. The second line just calls the `run_tests`
Perl function imported automatically from the `Test::Nginx::Socket` module
to run all the test cases defined in the data part of the test file (i.e.,
the things coming after the `{special_data_line}` line).

There are, however, more complicated prologue parts in many real-world
test suites. Such prologues usually define some special environment variables
or Perl variables that can be shared and referenced in the test cases defined
in the "data part", or just call some other Perl functions imported by
the `Test::Nginx::Socket` module to customize the testing configurations
and behaviors for the current test file. We will return to such fancier
prologues in later sections. They can be very helpful in some cases.

NOTE: Perl allows function calls to omit the parentheses if the context
is unambiguous. So we may see Perl function calls without parentheses in
real-world test files' prologue part, like `run_tests;`. We may use such
forms in examples presented in later sections because they are more compact.

=== The Data Part

The data part is the most important part of any test files powered by `Test::Nginx`.
This is where test cases reside. It uses a simple specification format
to express test cases so that the user does not use Perl or any other general-purpose
languages to present the tests themselves. This special specification format
is an instance of Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) where the "domain" is
defined as testing code running upon or inside NGINX. Use of a DSL to present
test cases opens the door for presenting the test cases as _data_ instead
of code. This is also why `Test::Nginx` is a data-driven testing framework.

The test case specification in the data part is composed by a series of
_test blocks_. Each test block usually corresponds to a single test case,
which has a _title_, an optional _description_, and a series of _data sections_.
The structure of a test block is described by the following template.

[source,test-base]
----
=== title
optional description
goes here...
--- section1
value1 goes
here
--- section2
value2 is
here
--- section3
value3
----

==== Block Titles

As we can see, each test block starts with a title line prefixed by three
equal signs (`===`). It is important to _avoid_ any leading spaces at the
beginning of the line. The title is mandatory and is important to describe
the intention of the current test case in the most concise form, and also
to identify the test block in the test report when test failures happen.
By convention we put a `TEST N:` prefix in this title, for instance, `TEST
3: test the simplest form`. Don't worry about maintaining the test ordinal
numbers in these titles yourself, we will introduce a command-line utility
called link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openresty/openresty-devel-utils/master/reindex[reindex]
in a later section that can automatically update the ordinal numbers in
the block titles for you.

==== Block Descriptions

Each test block can carry an optional description right after the block
title line. This description can span multiple lines if needed. It is a
more detailed description of the intention of the test block than the block
title and may also give some background information about the current test.
Many test cases just omit this part for convenience.

==== Data Sections

Every test block carries one or more _data sections_ right after the block
description (if any). Data sections always have a name and a value, which
specify any input data fields and the _expected_ output data fields.

The name of a data section is the word after the line prefix `---`. Spaces
are allowed though not syntactically required after `---`. We usually use
a single space between the prefix and the section name for aesthetic considerations
and we hope that you follow this convention as well. The section names
usually contain just alphanumeric letters and underscore characters.

Section values are specified in two forms. One is all the lines after the
section name line, before the next section or the next block. The other
form is more concise and specifies the value directly on the same line
as the section name, but right after the first colon character (`:`). The
latter form requires that the value contains no line-breaks. Any spaces
around the colon are always discarded and never count as a part of the
section value; furthermore, the trailing line-break character in the one-line
form does not count either.

If no visible values come after the section name in either form, then the
section takes an empty string value, which is still a _defined_ value,
however. On the other hand, omitting the section name (and value) altogether
makes that section _undefined_.

`Test::Nginx` offers various pre-defined data section names that can be
used in the test blocks for different purposes. Some data sections are
for specifying input data, some are for expected output, and some for controlling
whether the current test block should be run at all.

It is best to explain data sections in a concrete test block example.

[source,test-base]
----
=== TEST 1: hello, world
This is just a simple demonstration of the
echo directive provided by ngx_http_echo_module.
--- config
location = /t {
    echo "hello, world!";
}
--- request
GET /t
--- response_body
hello, world!
--- error_code: 200
----

Here we have two input data sections, `config` and `request`, for specifying
a custom NGINX configuration snippet in the default `server {}` and the
HTTP request sent by the test scaffold to the test NGINX server, respectively.
In addition, we have one output data section, `response_body`, for specifying
the expected response body output by the test NGINX server. If the actual
response body data is different from what we specify under the `response_body`
section, this test case fails. We have another output data section, `error_code`,
which specifies its value on the same line of the section name. We see
that a colon character is used to separate the section name and values.
Obviously, the `error_code` section specifies the expected HTTP response
status code, which is 200.

Empty lines around data sections are always discarded by `Test::Nginx::Socket`.
Thus the test block above can be rewritten as below without changing its
meaning.

[source,test-base]
----
=== TEST 1: hello, world
This is just a simple demonstration of the
echo directive provided by ngx_http_echo_module.

--- config
location = /t {
    echo "hello, world!";
}

--- request
GET /t

--- response_body
hello, world!

--- error_code: 200
----

Some users prefer this style for aesthetic reasons. We are free to choose
whatever form you like.

There are also some special data sections that specify neither input nor
output. They are just used to _control_ how test blocks are run. For example,
the `ONLY` section makes _only_ the current test block in the current test
file run and all the other test blocks are skipped. This is extremely useful
for running an individual test block in any given file, which is a common
requirement while debugging a particular test failure. Also, the special
`SKIP` section can skip running the containing test block unconditionally,
handy for preparing test cases for future features without introducing
any expected test failures. We will visit more such "control sections"
in later sections.

We shall see, in a later section, that the user can define their own data
sections or extend existing ones by writing a little bit of custom Perl
code to satisfy more complicated testing requirements.

==== Section Filters

Data sections can take one or more _filters_. Filters are handy when you
want to adjust or convert the section values in certain ways.

Syntactically, filters are specified right after the section name with
at least one space character as the separator. Multiple filters are also
separated by spaces and are applied in the order they are written.

`Test::Nginx::Socket` provides many filters for your convenience. Consider
the following data section from the aforementioned test block.

[source,test-base]
----
--- error_code: 200
----

If we want to place the section value, 200, in a separate line, like below,

[source,test-base]
----
--- error_code
200
----

then the section value would contain a trailing new line, which leads to
a test failure. This is because the one-line form always excludes the trailing
new-line character while the multi-line form always includes one. To explicitly
exclude the trailing new-line in the multi-line form, we can employ the
`chomp` filter, as in

[source,test-base]
----
--- error_code chomp
200
----

Now it has exactly the same semantics as the previous one-line form.

Some filters have more dramatic effect on the section values. For instance,
the `eval` filter evaluates the section value as arbitrary Perl code, and
the Perl value resulted from the execution will be used as the final section
value. The following section demonstrates using the `eval` filter to produce
4096 a's:

[source,test-base]
----
--- response_body eval
"a" x 4096
----

The original value of the `response_body` section above is a Perl expression
where the `x` symbol is a Perl operator is used to construct a string that
repeats the string specified as the left-hand-side N times where N is specified
by the right-hand-side. The resulting 4096-byte Perl string after evaluating
this expression dictated by the `eval` filter will be used as the final
section value for comparison with the actual response body data. It is
obvious that use of the `eval` filter and a Perl expression here is much
more readable and manageable than directly pasting that 4096-byte string
in the test block.

As with data sections, the user can also define their own filters, as we
shall see in a later section.

=== A Complete Example

We can conclude this section by a complete test file example given below,
with both the prologue part and the data part.

[source,test-base]
----
use Test::Nginx::Socket 'no_plan';

run_tests();

__DATA__

=== TEST 1: hello, world
This is just a simple demonstration of the
echo directive provided by ngx_http_echo_module.
--- config
location = /t {
    echo "hello, world!";
}
--- request
GET /t
--- response_body
hello, world!
--- error_code: 200
----

We will see how to actually run such test files in the next section.

NOTE: The test file layout described in this section is exactly the same
as the test files based on other test frameworks derived from `Test::Base`,
the superclass of `Test::Nginx::Socket`, except those specialized test
sections and specialized Perl functions defined only in `Test::Nginx::Socket`.
All the `Test::Base` derivatives share the same basic layout and syntax.
They proudly inherit the same veins of blood.
